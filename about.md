Basketball and Mindfulness (BAM) is a program that develops skillful minds and bodies.  We practice habits that serve us both on and off the court.

Mindfulness is the cornerstone practice for noticing, observing, understanding, and ultimately integrating all the different aspects of our mind that shape our actions.  In this program we use a number of different puppets to bring to life the elements of our personality that can take over our thoughts and actions.  Below is a sampling of the cast of characters:
